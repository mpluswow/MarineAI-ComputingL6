    "output": "oral reefs are at the center of many coastal and island cultures around the world. For example, in the Kumulipo, the Hawaiian creation chant, the coral polyp was the first organism created, and from that all other life forms sprung forth. Though coral reefs face numerous threats, we can save them by keeping them healthy."

    "output": "here are two main types of corals: hard corals and soft corals. Hard corals, like elkhorn coral and staghorn coral, grow in colonies and are often referred to as \u201creef-building corals.\u201d Hard corals create skeletons out of calcium carbonate, a hard substance that eventually becomes rock. Overtime, this rock builds up to form the foundation of a coral reef and provides a structure upon which baby corals can settle. Hard corals depend upon tiny algae called zooxanthellae (pronounced zo-zan-THEL-ee) that live inside them. Together, they share a symbiotic relationship\u2014the corals provide the zooxanthellae with shelter, and in return, the zooxanthellae provide the corals with food."

    "input": "ell me about soft Coral",
    "output": "here are two main types of corals: hard corals and soft corals. Soft corals, like sea fingers and sea whips, are soft and bendable and often resemble plants or trees. These corals do not have stony skeletons and are non-reef-building corals\u2014instead, they grow wood-like cores and fleshy rinds for protection. Like hard corals, they tend to live in colonies."
